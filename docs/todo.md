# ENHANCEMENTS

## Should we use something like supabase to allow users to save settings? Any alternatives to consider?

## Dynamic layout: switch form/preview orientation based on raster direction (X-axis: form top/preview bottom, Y-axis: form left/preview right with animations)

## Save Tool settings to local storage
For future sessions.

## Add buttons next to each field to reset to default value

## Save/Load Project (json) buttons

# COSMETIC

## The H1 should pulse from a light to dark color (orange for production, purple for dev). And/or explore leveraging gradients for an interesting dynamic effect here (swirling through as the gradient settings cycle through phases).

## For the raster effect trail, maybe it could be implemented as additional copies of the main effect, staggered back in time and increasingly faded out. What do you think?

## Settings page - palette (swatches with amber, purple, green, blue, red, yellow, pink, white)

# BUGS

## Stock section shrinks once you enter dimensions. It should stay the same size.

## Investigate erroneous red input boxes
Some of the input boxes are red with the default values. Depth of pass=0.01, Feed rate=125, Safe Z=0.125

## On Mobile, the stock does not appear in the preview window after dimensions are entered. Once I toggle between X-Axis and Y-Axis, the stock appears.

# Add stepper to stepover field, stepping in 5% increments.
