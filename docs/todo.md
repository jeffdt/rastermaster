# Dynamic Layout
Dynamic layout: switch form/preview orientation based on raster direction (X-axis: form top/preview bottom, Y-axis: form left/preview right with animations)

# Dimension Display
The user needs some way to visualize the stock dimensions in the preview pane. This could be a ruler on the axes, or measured dimensions displayed on the edges of the stock The origin should be the lower-left corner of the stock.

# Source control
We need to get this into source control. Can you help me set that up?

# GitHub page deployment
I want to deploy this to a github page. I already have one available at jeffdt.com. Is it possible to map a github page to a subdomain, like rastermaster.jeffdt.com? Or does it have to be the main domain?
